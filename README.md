# Graph Processing with Heterogeneous Processors
Exploring graph algorithm execution across heterogenous processors.

## Goals
 - [x] Graph generation and I/O.
 - [ ] Construct BFS and SSSP kernels in C++ w/ OpenMP, CUDA, Vulkan.
 - [x] Benchmark suite for various epoch kernels.
 - [ ] Heterogeneous epoch kernels that uses both CPU and GPU variants.
