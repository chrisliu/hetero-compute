# Graph Processing with Heterogeneous Processors
Exploring graph algorithm execution across heterogeneous processors.

## Documentation
Find documentation under the [docs](https://github.com/chrisliu/hetero-compute/tree/master/docs).  For help, contact Chris on Slack or at [chrisliu@cs.ucla.edu](mailto:chrisliu@cs.ucla.edu).

## Goals
 - [x] Graph generation and I/O.
 - [ ] Construct BFS and SSSP kernels in C++ w/ OpenMP, CUDA, Vulkan.
 - [x] Benchmark suite for various epoch kernels.
 - [ ] Heterogeneous kernels that uses both CPU and GPU variants.
