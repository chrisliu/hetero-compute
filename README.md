# [Placeholder Name] Heterogenous Compute
Explores executing a graph kernel (SSSP;BFS) concurrently on a heterogeneous system (CPU, GPU; unified, RAM).

## Goals
 - [ ] Create a [R-MAT Kronecker graph generator](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~christos/PUBLICATIONS/siam04.pdf).
 - [ ] Write GPU kernels in Vulkan.

## Contributors
This project is lead by [Christopher Liu](https://chrisliu.org/) and  advised by Professor [Tyler Sorenson](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~tsorensen/).
